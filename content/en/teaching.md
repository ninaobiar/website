## Data Analysis

### Statistics Instruction 

##

Recently, I was able to help guide first-year undergraduates delve deeper into the world of statistics as a teaching assistant. I facilitated engaging laboratory sessions, empowering them with statistical analysis techniques and data interpretation skills. Collaborating closely with other instructors, we crafted lab materials and assessments to foster a deeper comprehension of statistical principles, making the subject both accessible and hopefully enjoyable.

## Indigenous Ways of Knowing

### Research Coach

## 
During my undergraduate degree at the University of Calgary, I was lucky enough to be a Course-Based Research Experiences Research Coach at the Taylor Institute of Teaching and Learning. Interacting with students from diverse cultural backgrounds, I helped develop projects and community partnerships. Additionally, I worked closely with the professor to present teaching material and provide mentorship throughout the student research journey for the culmination of the conference showcasing their projects.


### Land-based Learning

##
I am also grateful for facilitating land-based learning experiences for students, guided by an Elder, and evaluating discipline-based student work. I aided student projects during the formation of their hypotheses, experimental planning, and troubleshooting of projects. Moreover, my collaboration with a team of research coaches, students, and professors resulted in the publication of our work in a peer-reviewed research journal.
