## Data Analysis

### Statistics Instruction 

##

Recently, I was able to help guide first-year undergraduates delve deeper into the world of statistics as a teaching assistant. I facilitated engaging laboratory sessions, empowering them with statistical analysis techniques and data interpretation skills. Collaborating closely with other instructors, we crafted lab materials and assessments to foster a deeper comprehension of statistical principles, making the subject both accessible and hopefully enjoyable.

## Indigenous Ways of Knowing

### Research Coach

## 
During my undergraduate degree at the University of Calgary, I was lucky enough to be a Course-Based Research Experiences Research Coach at the Taylor Institute of Teaching and Learning. Interacting with students from diverse cultural backgrounds, I helped develop projects and community partnerships. Additionally, I worked closely with the professor to present teaching material and provide mentorship throughout the student research journey for the culmination of the conference showcasing their projects.


### Land-based Learning

##
I am also grateful for facilitating land-based learning experiences for students, guided by an Elder, and evaluating discipline-based student work. I aided student projects during the formation of their hypotheses, experimental planning, and troubleshooting of projects. Moreover, my collaboration with a team of research coaches, students, and professors resulted in the publication of our work in a peer-reviewed research journal. You can read more about how I navigated working through the course [here](https://cjur.ca/september-2022-volume-7-issue-2/).


## Student Testimonials

*"Nina is an amazing TA! She is organized and knowledgeable on the course material, while also kind and able to create positive relationships with students. She is a fair grader and gives constructive feedback on assignments. She answers all questions thoroughly and is always patient with us. I really enjoyed having her as my lab TA. Thanks so much, Nina!" ~ Student 1*

*"Helpful PowerPoint and reviews at every lab period, she can explain and summarize the class material very well." ~ Student 2*

*"Nina is the best! She was always there to help us and answer our questions, but she is also an amazing human being. The day that I was sick and couldn't come to the lab, she made a full plan of how to get me back on track and give me all the information I needed to submit my assignments on time. She even sat with us for over an hour one lab helping a group of us answer questions for our assignment that we didn't understand." ~ Student 3*
